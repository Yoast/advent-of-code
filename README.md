# advent-of-code
This repository provides Yoasters a means to share their solutions to the annual advent-of-code puzzles found on https://www.adventofcode.com/

Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as a speed contest, interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, or to challenge each other.

You don't need a computer science background to participate - just a little programming knowledge and some problem solving skills will get you pretty far. Nor do you need a fancy computer; every problem has a solution that completes in at most 15 seconds on ten-year-old hardware.

Since solving the puzzles _quickly_ gives more points, you should expect that the code in this repository...
- does not adhere to any style or standard, 
- is not easy to read
- to work more half the time!

## To join
Every year, a root folder will be added:

    \2019\
    \2020\
    \2021\
    etc.

You should create a subfolder with your name under the year you're solving puzzles for, e.g.

    \2019\user\
    \2019\otheruser\
    \2021\user\
    etc.
 
You can commit your work-in-progress and your solutions directly to your folder. There shouldn't be any merge conflicts, unless someone else is changing _your_ code!
It's probably wise to separate every puzzle into its own folder:

    \2021\user\Day01
    \2021\user\Day08    
    \2021\user\Day10
    etc.
   
Tip: you can find the puzzles for previous events online at https://www.adventofcode.com/<year> e.g. https://www.adventofcode.com/2020 and it's still as much fun to solve them.
